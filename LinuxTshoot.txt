Linux Troubleshooting

# Since the initial issue reported is latency and high CPU utilization we will request the following log files and outputs

1. File /var/log/messages
# Check for any CPU throttle related messages
# Look for any possible error/failure on both files
# An example for general review
# egrep -i "error|fail|bad" <LOGFILE>
2. Output of:
$ dmesg -T > /tmp/dmesg.out

3. Outputs:
# We will catch 2-5 snapshots of the top command output
# Identify the process(es) using more resources
# Check for the following metrics:
# %CPU User Mode: The percentage of CPU utilization in user mode. This represents the time spent in user program execution and does not count for any time spent to complete the syscalls.
# %CPU System Mode: This value represents the time that processes spend in kernel mode, once they hit any syscall. Anything above 15% for this field is not healthy and indicates some issue with the OS that is slowing down the syscalls.
$ top -b -n 2 > top.txt
$ ps -eo pcpu,pid,user,args | sort -k 1 -r | head -10

# Run the below command to find the top threads that are utilizing CPU time, within a process if needed.
$ top -H -p <PID>

4. Ouput of:
$ iostat -x -c -d 4 50 2>&1 | tee /tmp/iostat.out

5. Check for memory comsuption:
$ free -h
$ vmstat 1 10

6. With this initial information we can confirm if the issue is OS/Hardware related or application related. Knowing that we can decide next steps
